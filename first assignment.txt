In voice biometrics, acoustic features are the measurable characteristics extracted from the speech signal 
that contain unique information about the speaker. These features are crucial in tasks like speaker 
verification, speaker identification, and speech recognition, as they represent both the physiological and 
behavioral aspects of a speakerâ€™s voice. The acoustic features are generally categorized into different 
types, including spectral, prosodic (relating to the pattern of rhythm and sound in poetry), and temporal 
features, and are used to build models that distinguish between different speakers.Speech-to-Text Systems: Acoustic features are also used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) 
systems to transcribe spoken words into text. Systems like Google Assistant or Siri rely on such 
features for understanding commands. Acoustic features like MFCCs are relatively robust against noise and channel variations, 
which is crucial for real-world applications where recordings may be done in different environments
